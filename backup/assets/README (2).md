# Assets Folder

This folder contains the application's visual assets.

## Required Assets

You need to add the following image files:

1. **icon.png** (1024x1024px) - App icon
2. **splash.png** (1242x2436px) - Splash screen image
3. **adaptive-icon.png** (1024x1024px) - Android adaptive icon
4. **favicon.png** (48x48px) - Web favicon

## Temporary Placeholder

For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares with the brand color (#8B0000 - dark red).

You can generate these using any image editor or online tools like:
- https://placeholder.com/
- Canva
- Figma
- Photoshop

## Brand Colors

Use these colors for your assets:
- Primary: #8B0000 (Dark Red)
- Secondary: #D4AF37 (Gold)
- Background: #FFFFFF (White)

The app will run without these files, but you'll see warnings in the console.
